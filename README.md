## Description
The FaceMoCap dataset provides a novel resource for the analysis and quantification of facial movements. Our dataset includes point cloud sequences that depict a variety of facial gestures from both healthy adults and patients with facial palsy. This dataset has been carefully collected and processed into a readily accessible Python dataframe, offering potential applications in areas such as facial gesture recognition, patient follow-up, and imputation of missing values. 

## Included Facial Gestures
Our dataset covers five specific types of facial movements:

1. Gentle eyelid closure
2. Forced eyelid closure
3. Labial protrusion on "o" sound
4. Labial protrusion on "Î¼ou" sound
5. A wide smile
